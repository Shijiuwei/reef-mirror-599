"""The text proposer off pi: each harness's own facts reach the request, its plan and its review.

On pi the proposer writes extensions against the API reference; on every
other adapter it writes rules, skills and commands, plus a config entry
where the harness's config can enforce a behavior. These tests pin what the
prompts say per adapter (the rules file, how a command is typed, the tools,
how a mode is built), which config keys an entry may set, and the reasons a
step records when a reply gives nothing to apply.
