"""The page per filed harness request: the step's state while it runs, the result once its row lands.

``GET /reef/harness/requests/{record_id}/page`` renders it from the request's
agent record, the catalog and the running step's progress, and a browser opens
it by a link that carries the scenario and a page key as query parameters. The
live chain here runs in ``training_mode: manual`` with a proposer that holds
its step open until the test has read the page mid-step.
