"""The shipped harness requests entries: seeded by config after the notice, rendered byte exact, reserved.

``evolution.requests: true`` appends the adapter's ``code_extension`` and
``skill`` entries to the seed; the same load and render paths as every
other node carry them, a pi release carries the rendered files alone (the
entries live in the commit log the service proposer reads), and adapters
without a shipped extension refuse boot naming them. The
assets are read through ``_ASSETS``, so these tests write placeholders and
point the module at them; the shipped files are checked when present.
