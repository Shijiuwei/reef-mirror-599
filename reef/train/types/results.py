    The publication fields are a small ordered precedence rather than four
    independent flags: ``artifact`` (bytes already materialized) outranks
    ``checkpoint_path`` (bytes the backend exported, still to be imported),
    which outranks a bare ``runtime_load_id`` (live weights only). Setting both
    ``artifact`` and ``runtime_load_id`` is normal for a durable train step; the
    version travels in the artifact's metadata. Combinations with no meaning
    are rejected here instead of being silently dropped by ``publication``.

    ``pending`` asks for the publication to be minted into the catalog without
    being served, for a person to promote later. It is a publication decision,
    so it travels as a field rather than as a metrics key: only durable bytes
    can be held back, and a step that publishes live weights or nothing at all
    is rejected here instead of having the request silently dropped.

    ``component`` names the release component ``artifact`` replaces. A scenario
    serving several components requires it; the committer carries the other
    components forward from the previous checkpoint. A flat scenario may leave
    it unset.
