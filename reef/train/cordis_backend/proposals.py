"""The proposal inbox: agent proposals a scenario holds until the next evolve step takes one.

A proposal arrives through ``POST /reef/harness/proposals`` once the route
admitted it against the head release's entries, and waits as one JSON file
directly under the scenario's inbox directory. ``prepare_step`` claims the
oldest by renaming it into ``claimed/`` before it applies anything, so a
crash between the claim and the settlement never applies it twice; admission
then runs again against the step's entries, a refusal moves the file to
``refused/`` with the reason, and the evaluation's result moves it to
``settled/`` with the result appended. Plain files, so a reader can inspect
every state with ``ls`` and ``cat``.
