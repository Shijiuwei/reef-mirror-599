"""Computed-feedback engine: judge records asynchronously, batch the results.

The sibling of :class:`~reef.train.processors.reported.ReportedFeedbackProcessor`
for the other way feedback arrives. A reported-feedback recipe is handed
explicit reports; a computed-feedback recipe produces its signal from the traffic itself — a
record only becomes judgeable when some LATER record completes it, and
the judgment itself calls models, so it runs asynchronously on a private
worker. This engine owns everything between those facts and the trainer:
the record lifecycle, the judging worker, the batch cycle, buffer release, and
crash-replay semantics. A recipe subclasses it and writes four methods:

* ``ingest(record)`` — the method's own correlation, written with the
  engine's verbs: start with ``catch_up``, ``dispatch`` each completed
  record's job, then ``track`` the record or ``retire`` it;
* ``judge(job)`` — an async coroutine producing the recipe's judgment,
  run on the worker's thread;
* ``make_sample(record, judgment)`` — one judged record into a
  :class:`TrajectoryItem`, or ``None`` for a record that cannot train;
* ``make_batch(samples, batch_number)`` — the selected samples into the
  recipe's batch type.

The ingest stays recipe code on purpose: for a computed-feedback method the
correlation IS the method, so its whole line reads in the recipe file.

Everything here is reconstructible state: after a crash the trainer replays the
un-acknowledged tail and judging re-runs, recompute bounded by the
training backlog; a record whose judgment was in flight is lost — one
record's exposure.
