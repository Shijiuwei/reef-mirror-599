"""Storage for the release chain: every publication as an immutable release.

The package owns bytes and heads — persisted, staged, materialized on
demand. *When* a head moves is the scenario committer's decision, one
level up. Boundaries this package holds:

- Repository backends are scenario-agnostic. A backend stores one
  repository; the factory owns the scenario-name-to-backend mapping. Nothing
  here knows what a scenario, trainer, or commit log is;
  ``ArtifactReleaseChain``'s caller decides transaction ordering.
- Releases are immutable and heads move only by compare-and-swap
  (``advance_current`` takes ``expected``; ``publish`` takes
  ``expected_parent``), so concurrent publication conflicts loudly
  (``ArtifactConflict``) instead of losing a release.
- A ``local:`` release has identity but no durable bytes; recovery and
  rollback refuse it as a restore source (``ReleaseNotRestorable``).

Adding a storage backend: implement ``RepositoryBackend`` and expose it
through a ``CachedRepositoryBackendFactory`` subclass; the dispatcher takes
any ``RepositoryBackendFactory``. ``tests/reef_service/test_reef_git_lfs.py``
and ``test_reef_artifacts.py`` show the contract a backend must satisfy.

Backends used with a scenario commit log must subclass
``StagedReleaseRepositoryBackend``. ``publish`` must accept
``advance_head=False`` and persist resolvable bytes without advancing its head.
After the scenario commit log is durable, ``commit_release(ref, expected_parent=...)``
advances that pointer. It must be idempotent when ``ref`` is already current and
reject an unrelated head. A failed pointer update is repaired from the commit log
on restart; the pointer never overrides committed scenario state. The memory
and Git LFS backends implement this contract. Backends without this capability
are rejected before scenario creation or recovery when a commit log is configured.
They remain usable without a commit log.
