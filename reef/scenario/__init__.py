"""Scenario state, commit, and recovery contracts.

A scenario owns one runtime binding, trainer, artifact chain, and store session.
The modules follow these responsibilities:

- ``scenario`` exposes operations on one instance; ``binding`` freezes its
  deployment-selected admission, surface, runtime, and inference backend.
- ``registry`` owns loaded instances, per-scenario locks, model updates, and
  scenario archival coordination. It caches concrete ``runtime.model_config.ModelConfig``
  instances and calls ``storage.model_config`` functions for private JSON files.
  Recipes and the factory receive only the current scenario's configuration.
- ``factory`` registers the base artifact, validates release selectors,
  opens storage, reconciles committed state, synchronizes and
  activates the checkpoint, builds the trainer, and replays retained records.
  It returns a complete ``Scenario`` and closes owned resources on failure.
- ``committer`` orders commit, rollback, retries, and artifact publication
  around store settlement. Trainer state is exposed only after settlement.
  ``recipe.checkpoint_strategy`` selects steps that publish durable checkpoints.
- ``releases`` queries releases, artifact content, and committed training metadata.
  It shares the committer's publication lock. Writers take the operation lock
  before the publication lock; readers never take the operation lock, so long
  training preparation does not block serving. ``history`` pages retained
  records and commits for the dispatcher.
Persisted values and metadata encoding belong to ``reef.storage.commits``.
Recovery reads a ``CommitRecord`` (none at initial registration). Storage
contracts and implementations never import this package.

The aggregate never reaches back to its recipe; the factory and registry
compose recipes at construction. Application assembly supplies
its storage service; the dispatcher owns its lifecycle and each
scenario owns one opened session. Artifact publication and recovery ordering
remain in this package.
