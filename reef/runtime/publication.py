"""Weight publication, commit gating, version allocation, and LoRA residency.

Three objects cooperate here, bottom-up:

- :class:`AdapterResidencyManager` accounts for the LoRA adapters one shared
  engine holds, so several scenarios cannot overcommit its slots.
- :class:`BackendWeightPublisher` moves weights from a training sender to an
  inference receiver, allocating each transfer's identity and verifying
  every engine afterwards.
- :class:`TrainingPublication` owns the durable job-marker transitions and
  the barrier that keeps a published version unserved until Reef commits it.

:class:`WeightUpdateLock` fences the native transport those objects drive.
