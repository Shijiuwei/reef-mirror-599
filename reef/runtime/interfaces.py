"""Shared training and inference contracts, values, and default request admission.

Who implements what:

- Recipes and the dispatcher *use* ``InferenceRuntime`` and ``TrainingRuntime``
  and the values they exchange (``ModelCandidate``, ``ActivatedModel``,
  ``PreparedTrainingStep``, ``TrainingJobResult``). These are the backbone.
- A training integration *implements* ``TrainingBackend`` (with
  ``PreparedTrainingJob``) so Reef's coordinator can drive it.
- An inference integration *implements* ``InferenceHandler`` for requests,
  ``InferenceBackend`` for weight receipt, and ``InferenceMemoryOperations``
  and ``AdapterEngine`` for the memory and adapter operations ``scheduler``
  and ``publication`` call back into. The engine supervision hooks live in
  ``recovery`` next to the objects that drive them.
- Reef itself implements the durable stores (``TrainingJobStore``,
  ``ScenarioHistoryStore``); they are abstract here only so ``publication``
  and ``recovery`` can share them without importing each other.

The module reads top-down in that order: identities and errors, training
values, request admission, request handling, runtime contracts, native
backend contracts, durable stores.
