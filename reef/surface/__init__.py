"""Serving capabilities a scenario exposes for its frozen release.

``Surface`` is a frozen composition of named components, each binding
optional capabilities — ``validator``, ``loader``, ``inference``, ``files`` —
and callers inspect fields, never subclass identity. The invariant is version fidelity: the consumer observes exactly
the frozen version, and Reef records the exchange against it. The design,
every call site, and the bundled surfaces are documented at
https://reefinfra.ai/docs/developer-guide/surface/.

The package depends only on ``artifact`` and ``core``; it sees runtimes
through the ``ServingRuntime`` and ``WeightRuntime`` abstract bases and never
imports a concrete one.
