"""``reef serve`` — start managed inference, connect a provider, or run a configured stack.

Version 2 and CLI-only input describe components, not process definitions.
Reef assembles inference, training and HTTP processes, and the generator service of a
``generator`` section. Other method services are independently deployed; recipes consume
their endpoints. Unversioned files retain their explicit
``services`` process contract. All paths share the existing executor lifecycle,
readiness and cleanup machinery. HTTP assembly lives in :mod:`reef.service.assembly`.

Module responsibilities:
    config_utils: YAML loading, environment interpolation and recipe source paths.
    service_config: Typed shared settings consumed by HTTP app assembly.
    deployment_config: Selected component schemas, public layout and validation.
    cli: CLI help, dotted override syntax and precedence.
    inference / training: Component-specific process and runtime assembly.
    generator: The generator service child a ``generator`` section adds before the HTTP service.
    execution: Process definition validation and executor selection.
    diagnostics: Resolved settings and their sources for the startup log.
    process / guard: Worker process lifecycle and remote-owner cleanup.
    orchestrator: Launch coordination, supervision and HTTP child entrypoint.

Shared type conversion lives in ``reef.core.config``; native argument encoding
lives in ``reef.runtime.executor.arguments``. Import those owners directly.
