"""Reefine's agent proposer: a pi session that makes the change a request asks for, tries it, and hands it back.

The text proposer (:mod:`reef.recipe.reefine.evolution`) writes a request's
entries in a few model calls and never runs them. This proposer gives the
request to a coding agent instead: pi, the harness being evolved, with the
tree laid out as one file per entry in its working directory, the network, and
three tools of its own. ``harness_check`` runs the workspace through Reef's
admission; ``harness_trial`` runs an online task or scripted session checks;
``harness_progress`` saves findings that stay available after compaction.
When the agent stops, its workspace is read back into mutations and reviewed
like the text proposer's answer.

The agent holds no credential. Online model and provider calls go through
a loopback gateway (:mod:`reef.recipe.reefine.agent_gateway`) that spends from
the step's model-call budget and records into ``proposer.json``. Its isolation
is the executor the deployment built for it (``evolution.proposer_agent.sandbox``).
Scripted trials use a fixed local model in that same executor.

A step without a request, or a deployment without ``proposer_agent``, is
answered by the text proposer as before.
