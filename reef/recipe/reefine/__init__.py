"""Reefine: built-in harness refinement from a user's training instructions.

``ReefineRecipe`` binds the served-model proposer to the shared Cordis loop.
It accepts the same ``evolution`` settings as ``CordisRecipe``; the shipped
``reefine`` profile supplies the health task and seed. Custom tasks should
also supply their own ``evolution.evaluate`` scorer. The bundled scorer only
recognizes the profile's health task.

    ``evolution.multimodal`` names a gateway for images, embeddings, speech and

    Selection is ``floor``: the evaluation runs the candidate alone on the

    ``evolution.floor_score``. The floor checks that the tree still works
    (the model binding, the tools, the extensions load), not that the
    requested change does; the step's design and review notes and the
    person judge that. Override ``evolution.selection`` to compare scores
    against the current release, and ``training-mode`` to learn from
