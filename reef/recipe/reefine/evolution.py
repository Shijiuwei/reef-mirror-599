"""Reefine's served-model proposer and the profile's health task scorer.

A request is answered design first: the served model restates it, names what
triggers the behavior, what state the harness must know and what only the
user can provide, then writes the entries; a second call reviews the entries
against the request. What only the user can provide is declared as a
``requires`` item with a prompt sentence for setup, never asked for by the
extension at run time. Without an instruction the proposer learns from
failing reports. The shared backend owns admission, evaluation, publication,
and extension review.
