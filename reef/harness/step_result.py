"""What a settled harness step means for the person who asked, as the wrapper and the harness pages say it.

The wrapper prints one result line and the next commands in a terminal; the
request and version pages render the same result and next action in HTML.
Both read a catalog row's metrics through these functions, so a rejected
step names the same cause and a release offers the same install commands in
either place.
