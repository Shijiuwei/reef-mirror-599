// Harness requests: the /reefine and /versions commands and the
// reef_ask_user and reef_file_request tools for reef-pi. The person asks in
// plain words. With a UI the command clarifies the request in the background:
// a loop beside the session calls the session's model with the request, the
// recent conversation and the two tools, asks what is unclear (reef_ask_user)
// and files it (reef_file_request). The chat keeps one collapsed entry for it,
// whose expanded view holds the whole clarification, so the session's own
// context and transcript stay free of it; with --direct, or headless, the
// command files it as is. A filed request goes to
// reef with this session's id and the installed release through native manual
// training, and every filing answers with a link to the request's page. The
// service proposer writes the change, and a watch here polls the catalog, shows
// in the footer whether the request is queued or its step is running and for
// how long, and reports the step's result in the session as a custom message
// the chat keeps, with why the proposer produced nothing when it did. The
// filed requests not yet reported are kept beside the release file, so a
// restarted pi reports their results at its next session start. /versions
// lists the release chain with each step's result and request, marks the step
// this tree runs as installed and the newest published one as current, and
// offers a step's page, which holds the design, the review and the numbers.
// A settled step offers its install once the session is between turns, so a
// win reaches the person who asked without them going looking; a busy session
// keeps the report's commands instead. /versions <step> install runs the
// same install on demand, promoting a release held back from the served head
// first, so installing is the one decision. Nothing here writes
// a mutation. Kept free of annotations on purpose: plain JavaScript in a .ts file, so plain
// node can parse it in CI and pi's TS loader accepts it unchanged; pi-tui, which draws the entry, is imported
// lazily from pi's own loader, so plain node loads the file without it. Evaluation
// episodes set PI_OFFLINE and this extension then registers nothing, so the
