"""Reef harness wrapper: a capture proxy between the agent binary and Reef.

When invoked with agent arguments (e.g. ``reef-pi -p "fix the bug"``):

  Checks the installed release's requirements before starting the proxy or
  agent. Unmet items print their setup hints and exit 3. Required programs
  must still be on PATH, even when setup previously checked them off.

  1. Starts a local capture proxy (``reef_client.serve``) that forwards to
     Reef, injecting ``x-reef-scenario`` so the user's agent binary never
     needs to know about Reef headers.
  2. Rewrites the provider config in a temp copy of the composition to point
     the agent at the proxy instead of Reef directly.
  3. Runs the agent binary as a subprocess.
  4. After the agent exits, persists the captured receipts (the
     ``x-reef-agent-record-id`` values from each response) to disk.

When invoked with ``report`` (e.g. ``reef-pi report --score 0.0 --feedback "..."``):

  1. Claims the oldest pending run's persisted receipts.
  2. POSTs a report to Reef with all captured receipts as ``references``
     (one trajectory sample), or one report per receipt with ``--per-receipt``.
  3. Clears the persisted receipts.

When invoked with ``evolve`` (e.g. ``reef-pi evolve "text me when you are blocked"``,
``reef-pi evolve "..." --wait [--timeout SECONDS]``; ``harness`` remains a compatibility alias):

  Sends an explicit manual training instruction to ``POST /reef/train`` with
  the installed release and a session id: inside a session the wrapper
  started, that session's (``REEF_HARNESS_SESSION``, the tag every call of
  the run carries); outside one, the oldest pending session's (or a fresh id
  when nothing is spooled). The scenario must use ``training_mode: manual``
  or ``hybrid``. Acceptance queues a step without inference receipts or a
  feedback report; the merged ``requires`` list rides ``training_request``
  in the commit's metrics. The accepted line is followed by a link to the
  request's page, the ``page_path`` the service answered with (its query
  holds the scenario and a page key, never the token, so a browser opens it
  as is). With
  ``--wait`` the wrapper polls the release catalog every 5 s for the step
  that consumed the request (``--timeout`` seconds, 1800 by default), says
  once when the request's progress shows a step took it, and prints the
  result with the next action (a pending release says it is not installed
  until promoted and names its page link; a skipped step's line quotes why
  the proposer produced nothing): exit 0 for a selected or pending release,
  1 for a rejected or skipped step, 2 when the timeout passes first. On a
  terminal the result hands over the next step: a selected release asks
  ``Install now? [Y/n]`` and, on yes, runs the setup prompts for it and
  then ``update``, closing with ``Installed release <id>. Restart reef-pi
  to use it.``; a pending release names its page, asks ``Promote now?
  [y/N]`` and, on yes, posts the promote and installs the new head the same
  way. Declined, or without a terminal, the next commands are printed.

When invoked with ``wait`` (e.g. ``reef-claude wait <request id> --timeout 500``):

  Waits for the step that takes a request ``evolve`` already filed and
  reports it as ``evolve --wait`` does, with the same exit statuses. The
  shipped ``/reefine`` command of an adapter without its own extension
  files the request with ``evolve`` and calls ``wait --poll`` until it
  stops printing ``no result yet``, since the agent's shell tool stops a
  command after a few minutes; ``--poll`` exits 0 while the step still
  runs, where a plain ``wait`` exits 2, since a shell tool counts a
  nonzero exit as a failed call.

When invoked with ``page`` (e.g. ``reef-pi page 3``, ``reef-pi page 3 --print``):

  Fetches the step's page (``GET /reef/harness/releases/<step>/page``) with
  the token and the scenario header a browser would not send into
  ``$XDG_CACHE_HOME/reef-harness/<scenario>-step-<step>.html`` (``~/.cache``
  by default), prints the path and opens it with ``open`` (macOS) or
  ``xdg-open``; ``--print`` prints the path and opens nothing.

When invoked with ``doctor`` (e.g. ``reef-pi doctor``):

  Prints one line per thing an install needs and exits 0 when they all hold:
  the interpreter behind the wrapper and whether it imports reef and
  reef-client, the service address and whether the token is accepted, the
  agent binary and its version, the tools the adapter wants on PATH, the
  installed release against the served head, every program a ``binary``
  requires item of the installed release names (looked for on PATH, never
  run), and any release that waits for a person's review with its step page.

When invoked with ``setup`` (e.g. ``reef-pi setup``, ``reef-pi setup --yes``,
``reef-pi setup --mark <name>``, ``reef-pi setup --release <id>``, ``reef-pi setup --json``,
``reef-pi setup --set NAME=VALUE``, ``reef-pi setup --run NAME``):

  1. Reads what the newest release that is not pending (``--release <id>``
     names any catalog release instead, a pending one included) requires of
     you: every ``training_request.requires`` item over the release's chain
     in ``GET /reef/harness/releases``, merged by name as the manifest merges
     them (``permission``, ``env``, ``service`` or ``binary`` items, each with
     an optional ``check`` and an optional ``prompt``, one sentence saying what
     to enter, grant or install), the check offs the ``.reef-harness-release`` release file
     records under ``setup``, and the values the ``.reef-harness-env`` env
     file beside it holds.
  2. Prints every item with its check as written and its prompt. An ``env``
     item is met when its variable (the check, else the name) is set in the
     environment or the env file; otherwise it asks for the value
     (``getpass`` when the name contains TOKEN, KEY, SECRET or PASSWORD,
     ``input`` else; ``--yes`` asks nothing) and stores it in the env file.
     For an unmet ``permission`` or ``service`` item it asks ``run it?
     [y/N]`` (``--yes`` answers yes) and runs the check through the shell,
     exit status zero meaning met. A ``binary`` item names a program: it is
     met when the program is on PATH and the item names no check, and when it
     names one, the program is looked for first and the check is then asked
     for and run the same way, so no check runs for a program that is not
     there. ``--mark <name>`` checks an item off by
     hand and runs nothing. A check off records the check it stood for, so
     an item whose check changed since counts as unmet and runs again.
  3. Records each met item in the release file's ``setup`` and exits 0 when every
     item is met, 1 otherwise. This is the one place a check ever runs: the
     install script only reads the check offs, and a session start prints
     what is unmet and exits 3 without starting the agent.

  Three flag forms serve scripts and the extensions, one item at a time:
  ``--json`` prints ``{"release_id": ..., "items": [{name, kind, check,
  prompt, met}, ...]}`` for the release to set up and runs nothing (exit 0);
  ``--set NAME=VALUE`` stores the value of the ``env`` item NAME in the env
  file and checks it off (exit 0; an unknown or non-env name is exit 2; the
  value is an argument, never shell source, and stays one line); ``--run
  NAME`` runs that one item's check without asking, the caller having
  confirmed it, and checks it off when it passes (exit 0 when met, 1
  otherwise, 2 for an unknown name).

When invoked with ``update`` (e.g. ``reef-pi update``, ``reef-pi update --release <id>``):

  Fetches the install script (``GET /reef/harness/install?adapter=<adapter>``,
  plus ``&release_id=<id>`` with ``--release``) with the token and the
  scenario header, runs it with ``bash`` for this install root, and prints
  the installed release: exit 0, or 1 when the fetch or the script fails.
  While the release requires an item that is not met, the items are printed
  and nothing is fetched: exit 3, since the script would refuse anyway;
  this says why first. When called from an active session into its own install
  directory, setup and update use that session's service, scenario, and token.
  A successful update restores the installation to the session's configuration
  even if another install rewrote it. Commands targeting another install directory
  use that directory's configuration. An unknown release reports the service and
  scenario whose catalog was queried; it never substitutes a different release.

When invoked with ``--help``, ``-h`` or ``help``:

  Prints the wrapper's own usage (the subcommands above; anything else runs
  the agent), then, for ``--help`` and ``-h``, runs the agent with the same
  arguments so its help follows.

Env vars (baked into the wrapper at install time):

  ``REEF_HARNESS_BINARY``    absolute path to the agent binary
  ``REEF_HARNESS_COMPOSE``   absolute path to the composition directory
  ``REEF_HARNESS_SCENARIO``  the reef scenario name
  ``REEF_HARNESS_ADAPTER``   adapter name (any descriptor whose env relocates its composition
                             with a {root}/<dir> entry; terminus has none and gets no wrapper)
  ``REEF_HARNESS_ENV_VAR``   the env var that relocates the composition

Optional:

  ``REEF_TOKEN``  bearer token for the reef service (if auth is enabled); unset, the wrapper
                  uses the token the install wrote into the tree's model binding

The env file, ``<install root>/.reef-harness-env`` beside the release file,
holds the values the person gave ``setup`` for ``env`` items: ``NAME=VALUE``
lines, mode 0600, written by ``setup`` alone. A session run through the
wrapper gets each variable unless the shell already sets it (the shell
wins); the values never enter the tree and are never sent anywhere. The
wrapper also exports ``REEF_HARNESS_WRAPPER``, the path of the ``reef-<adapter>``
script at the install root, so an extension in the agent can run ``update``
and ``setup`` from the session.
