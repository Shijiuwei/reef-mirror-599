"""The harness layer: a coding agent's composition as a tree, rendered, run and served.

The map, one subpackage per job:

``compose/``
    the composition engine shared by resident serving and the evolution backend.
``tree/``
    what a composition is: the node kinds and their admission (``nodes``), and
    how a tree renders to one harness's files (``render``), and mutation admission
    shared by serving and training (``mutations``).
``adapters/``
    one directory per agent, the mapping only: a ``descriptor.yaml`` (schema in
    ``descriptor``) plus quirks, and the ``harness_facts.yaml`` a text proposer
    reads about the harness's own surface (``harness_facts``). pi, opencode, claude, codex, dsh, hermes, and
    the two programs Reef ships, native and terminus.
``episodes/``
    one headless run and its reading: launch on a rendered root, locally or
    in a jail (``run``, ``executor``), the model binding, the version pin and
    the trajectory readers.
``runners/``
    the programs an adapter's ``binary`` points at when Reef ships them:
    ``native`` (the loop, its graph, its seed and the resident ``serve`` form)
    and ``terminus`` (the Harbor runner).
``client/``
    what runs on a user's machine: the wrapper the install script bakes
    around a pulled harness.
``step_result``
    what a settled step means for the person who asked, and the next action
    it offers: the words the wrapper prints and the harness pages render.

This package depends on core values and runtime contracts, never on training,
recipes, scenario coordination, or the HTTP service.

The evolution loop itself, propose, gate and publish, is
``reef.train.cordis_backend``; versioning (staging, publishing, the commit
log, recovery and rollback) is reef's artifact stack (``reef.artifact``,
``reef.scenario.committer``), not here.

Vocabulary note: ``reef.surface.harnesses`` delivers a *harness artifact* to
a client program; this package evolves the *harness composition itself* by
driving a real coding agent binary per episode.
