"""Episode lifecycle: render, launch headless, collect, clean up exactly.

One episode is one process of the harness binary inside a throwaway root:
the rendered files land under the root, the descriptor's relocation
environment points the binary's entire composition at it, the binary runs
headless in an empty ``workspace/`` working directory, and the trajectory is
read back before the root is removed. Both surveyed harnesses re-read their
whole composition at process start and accept environment variables that
relocate their config and session roots, so the inverse of an episode is
exactly "delete the root" - no shared state survives.

Cleanup is audited, not assumed: every file found under the root that the
episode did not write, is not under ``workspace/`` (the task's own output
area), and does not match the descriptor's cleanup whitelist is reported as
``residue``. The whitelist is where adapter traps live - opencode's boot
mutates its own config directory (npm install, ``.gitignore``), and both
harnesses write session storage; those are declared, everything else is a
finding.
