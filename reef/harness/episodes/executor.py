"""How an episode's process runs, behind an interface.

``run_episode`` owns the executor-agnostic work: it prepares the episode root,
writes the rendered composition, builds the environment, reads the trajectory,
and collects residue. Only the launch of the harness process differs between a
development run and a hosted one, so that step is the seam:

* :class:`LocalExecutor` runs the binary as a plain subprocess in its own
  session, exactly as before. It is the default, used for development and the
  hermetic tests.
* :class:`SandboxExecutor` runs the same binary inside a bubblewrap jail: a
  fresh non-root namespace, a read-only base filesystem with only the episode
  root exposed (its workspace and declared runtime state writable, rendered
  inputs read-only), only explicitly forwarded deployment environment, resource limits,
  network disabled unless an egress allowlist is configured, and death with
  the parent.

A deployment selects the executor by config; a hosted deployment that requires
the sandbox refuses to start when the sandbox runtime is unavailable, through
:meth:`EpisodeExecutor.preflight`.
