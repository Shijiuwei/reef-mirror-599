"""Run episode processes in an E2B cloud sandbox that reaches the Reef host only through a tunnel.

An E2B sandbox is a microVM of its own, with the internet but no route to the
machine Reef runs on. :class:`E2BExecutor` is the deployment's setting (the
API key, the template, how long a sandbox may live); :meth:`E2BExecutor.open`
starts one sandbox and answers an :class:`E2BSession`, which launches any
number of processes in it until it is closed. Each process's root is copied
in before it starts and copied back once it ends, so the caller reads what
it wrote as a local run leaves it; :meth:`E2BSession.pull` refreshes a
directory while a process still runs.

A port in ``forward_ports`` is reachable inside the sandbox at the same
loopback address it has on the Reef host, so no URL handed to a process
changes. The sandbox runs :mod:`reef.harness.episodes.e2b_relay` on that port;
a :class:`TunnelPump` on the Reef host polls the relay over E2B's public
address for each request a process made, sends it to the local port, and
streams the answer back. Only the forwarded ports are reachable this way, and
every credential stays on the Reef side of them.

The template is the harness's pinned binary on Node 22; one Reef builds on
first use (about a minute) when the alias does not exist yet.

A sandbox carries its deployment as ``owner``; a Reef that stopped mid run
never closed its sandbox, so before a process starts its first sandbox it
stops the ones its deployment left (:meth:`E2BExecutor.reap_once`), and never
another deployment's. It waits for that first sandbox rather than reaping at
start: a second start that cannot bind the port serves no request, so it
never reaches a peer's sandbox that is still in use.
