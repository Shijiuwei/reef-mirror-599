"""Context: the entry point of the calculus, with property-mediated access.

A Context is a view onto one composition tree: reading an unknown attribute
resolves it as a service through the walk of the paper's Algorithm 6, and
writing one is guarded so only a provider mutates its own service. Python's
attribute protocol is the interposition primitive: ``__getattr__`` fires
only after normal lookup fails, which gives the reference proxy's fast path
for free. ``extend`` derives a child view that shares the tree but carries
its own overrides; recovery of a derived context is discarding it.
``isolate`` remaps one service name to a private realm for the derived
subtree; ``intercept`` overlays per-scope config that services resolve at
use time through ``Service.resolve_config``.

Access control, stated plainly: reading key K on a context succeeds iff
some fiber on its lineage (itself, an ancestor, or root) holds K in its
committed store, because it provides K or declared and committed K at load,
and the lineage does not cross a realm boundary for K on the way. A
declared but uncommitted K is the inactive error; a K nowhere on the
reachable lineage is the undeclared error, enforced at the point of use.

The whole package assumes one thread and, when asyncio is used, one event
loop: composition state interleaves only at iteration boundaries, so no
locks are taken. Free-threaded Python and multi-loop use are out of scope.
