"""Records to datasets: a served model writes Harbor tasks, Reef checks and plays them, a processor trains on the episodes.

The processor that generates tasks (:class:`reef.train.processors.TaskGenerationProcessor`) runs inside
the Reef service, where nothing may block the trainer and nothing should need Docker. The slow, container
bound steps therefore run in the generator service, a process ``reef serve`` starts beside the HTTP
service when a deployment carries a ``generator`` section, and the processor drives it over HTTP:

- ``designer``: the task contract as a prompt, the served model asked for one task through Reef (every
  proposal an inference record with a receipt), the reply parsed into the instruction, the files and a hint.
- ``harbor``: the reply held to the authoring rules, the task written with ``reef.core.tasks``, tasks
  deduplicated by content, Harbor's oracle and nop agents run through the ``harbor`` command line, a split
  per generation.
- ``service``: the HTTP API and its job runner; ``client``: the same steps as asynchronous calls for a
  processor; ``wire``: the JSON forms. The ``generator`` section that starts the service is parsed in
  ``reef.service.deploy.generator``, beside the process it describes.

What is method policy, the prompt's experience section, the arms a task is played with and the score a
proposal earns, stays with the method's processor (``recipes/beta/spade`` is the first).
