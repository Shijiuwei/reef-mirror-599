Continual OPD on Reef: framework
=================================

:Status: Deprecated

.. warning::

   This historical RFC predates the issue-based RFC process and will be removed
   in a future cleanup.

   A small model serves by default; a verifier flags tasks it handles poorly and
   escalates them to a large model; escalated trajectories are continually
   distilled back into the small model (hard distillation + soft on-policy
   distillation, including cross-tokenizer). The intended result is a lower
   escalation rate and a steadily falling cost per solved task as the small
   model improves.

1. **Router:** v1 lives on the harness side (~50 LoC). The student runs first;
   if the verifier fails it, the task is retried on the teacher. This requires no
   Reef changes: two scenarios, each bound to its own recipe/upstream
   (multi-recipe deployments are natively supported).
2. **Verifier:** the existing report score is the verifier. v1 targets domains
   where verification is free (code via unit tests, math via numeric checks).
3. **Distillation:** layers run from cheapest to most expensive (see §2).
   Escalated samples filling a batch provide the trigger, using Reef's native
   processor training mechanism, so no separate trigger is needed.
4. **Trust evolution:** track per-domain student pass rates; once a domain
   clears the bar, escalation is switched off there (keeping a small audit
   sample; dropping below the floor re-enables it). Thresholds and state
   eventually become versioned artifacts; v1 uses a simple EMA + fixed
   threshold.

The code already provides the required OPD backend. Slime includes teacher
scoring, reverse-KL, an end-to-end ``teacher_log_probs`` pipeline, and frozen
heterogeneous teacher engines. The Reef↔slime bridge now carries it
too: ``opd`` is in the bridge's algorithm whitelist, and after the bridge
receives a batch it calls the teacher for scoring and directly constructs
per-token advantages
(``β·clip(RMSNorm(teacher_logp − rollout_logp), −c, c)``; optional centering
happens before RMS normalization) through the existing channel. This requires
no slime-core changes and leaves the client contract unchanged.

.. _3-roadmap:

3. Roadmap
----------

- **Phase 0 (no code changes):** run the loop with dual scenarios, a harness
  router + verifier + the L0 hard-distillation loop. Deliverables: end-to-end
  engineering validation plus all baselines.
- **Phase 1 (core development, shipped):** L1 same-vocab OPD through the
  bridge, implemented in ``reef/train/slime_backend/reef_adapters/``
  plus one cookbook backend-preparer file (the removed ``examples/opd``
  prototype exercised this end to end; see git history).
- **Phase 2:** cross-tokenizer alignment library + L2; automate trust
  evolution and rollback.

5. Long-term items (backlog, to be detailed later)
--------------------------------------------------

Bridge/algorithm registry (#81) · first-class per-token signal channel ·
streaming traces as training records · distribution-level cross-tokenizer
distillation (the teacher server's candidate-scoring primitive is implemented
and awaiting a consumer) · router inside Reef with composite versions (see
the README roadmap) ·
anti-forgetting replay · learned verifier/router · LoRA-adapter distillation
steps.

.. _6-main-risks-one-mitigation-each:

6. Main risks (one mitigation each)
-----------------------------------

Student learning to exploit verifier blind spots → prefer executable checks +
always-on audit sampling + probe-set rollback; hard-distillation distribution
shift → move to on-policy L1/L2 quickly; catastrophic forgetting → replay +
standing general-benchmark monitoring; teacher-scoring throughput → batch
scoring inside the bridge + independently scalable teacher engines.
