Reefine
========

Reefine is the built-in recipe for refining a pi coding harness from plain
language instructions. Its implementation is
``reef.recipe.reefine:ReefineRecipe``, and its proposer and evaluator ship in
the Reef wheel, so the service needs no tutorial checkout or training GPUs.

Start the bundled profile with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

.. code:: bash

   reef serve --recipe reefine \
     --inference.upstream-url http://127.0.0.1:11434 \
     --inference.upstream-model gemma4:26b \
     --inference.upstream-api-key dummy \
     --recipe.config.evolution.multimodal.api_key sk-or-...

For an OpenAI Responses or Anthropic endpoint, add
``--inference.upstream-api responses`` or ``--inference.upstream-api anthropic``.
The last line, an OpenRouter key (or ``REEF_MULTIMODAL_API_KEY``), gives the
harness image, speech, embedding and decision models (see
`Images, speech, embeddings and decisions`_); leave it out to go without them,
or when the upstream is OpenRouter.

The profile listens on ``127.0.0.1:8901``, requires no token unless ``REEF_TOKEN`` is set, and keeps
state under ``.reef/reefine/``. For custom deployments, copy
``reef/service/profiles/reefine.yaml`` and pass it with ``-c``. The
`Reefine tutorial <https://github.com/Human-Agent-Society/reef/tree/main/tutorials/reefine>`__
includes installation, bug-fix and research demos, and recorded measurements.

How it works
------------

1. Ask. In a ``reef-pi`` session, ``/reefine <what it should do>`` has
   the model think the change through in the background before anything is
   filed, while the chat shows one line (``ctrl+o`` expands the whole
   clarification) and the session keeps its input and context: when it
   triggers, what state the harness must know and how it learns it, what
   you must provide. It asks only about an open point that changes what
   gets built and that a reasonable default cannot settle, so a clear
   request files without a question; each question offers concrete options,
   the one it recommends first and marked, and it then files your original
   words with the answers as clarifications (``--direct`` as the first word
   files at once). From the shell, ``reef-pi evolve
   "<text>"`` posts the same instruction to ``POST /reef/train``; add
   ``--wait`` to stay until the step settles. Either ask prints the
   request's page link (``GET /reef/harness/requests/<id>/page``), which
   reloads every five seconds, naming the step's state, until the result
   is on it, ending with the design and how to use the change.
2. Step. In ``training-mode: manual`` the service runs one evolve step for
   each accepted instruction. Where the host can isolate it, a coding agent
   answers the instruction (see `The agent proposer`_): it edits the tree,
   runs the changed harness for real and hands the entries back, and a
   review call reads them against the request. Otherwise the served model
   answers it in a few calls: it writes a design first (the
   request in one sentence, what triggers the behavior, what state the
   harness must know and where it comes from, what only you can provide as
   ``requires`` items with a ``prompt`` each), then the entries, and a
   second call reviews them against the request. The review also says
   whether the entries deliver the requested behavior or only put a
   substitute in its place, such as a rule describing it. When the review
   is partial or finds a substitute, the model writes the answer again with
   the review's findings, up to three answers in all. The step keeps the
   delivering answer with the fewest uncovered points, and both pages say
   which answer it kept when it wrote more than one; when no answer
   delivers, it is skipped with the reason. A point the harness's facts say
   no answer there can deliver (a hard tool lockout on a harness whose
   commands cannot take a tool away) is a limit, listed apart from the
   uncovered points: it starts no retry, and the loop ends when only limits
   remain. The evaluation runs the candidate on the health task: it
   publishes when the tree still works, and both pages say the health task
   is no test of the requested behavior, which only the review reads; when
   every candidate episode fails before it is scored (the runner was not
   found, say), both pages say the evaluation could not run and quote the
   cause. The step's page carries the design and the review either way. A
   review call that answers with no text is asked once more with room for
   both its reasoning and its reply; when it still gives none, the step
   records why and both pages say the review did not run, rather than
   reading like a step that had no review to give.
3. Result. The session that asked reports it in the chat when the step
   settles, and ``reef-pi evolve ... --wait`` prints the same line:
   published as a release, ready but waiting for your review because it
   changes an extension, rejected by the evaluation, or skipped with the reason,
   followed by the points the review left uncovered.
4. Read. A release that touches a ``code_extension`` is held back from the
   served head, so it reaches no session on its own. ``/versions
   <step>`` opens its page (``reef-pi page <version>`` from the shell), which
   carries the design, how to use the change, the review and the numbers.
5. Install and set up. A step that settles while you are between turns offers
   its install there; otherwise run ``/versions <version> install``
   (``reef-pi update`` from the shell). A release held back from the head is
   served as part of installing it, so installing is the one decision. After
   confirmation, the session collects what the change needs: for each unmet ``requires`` item it shows the item's
   ``prompt`` and asks for the value of an ``env`` item, kept in
   ``.reef-harness-env`` beside the install, or for a confirmation before a
   ``permission`` or ``service`` check runs (``reef-pi setup`` asks the
   same from the shell). A release with an unmet item is never installed.
6. Reload. Type ``/reload`` in the session, or restart ``reef-pi``, and the
   new release is the harness you are talking to.

Behavior and configuration
--------------------------

* ``training-mode: manual`` runs one step for each accepted instruction on
  ``POST /reef/train``. Use ``hybrid`` to also learn from failing reports.
* The agent proposer, or the served model where the host cannot isolate the
  agent, proposes skills, rules, agent commands, or pi extensions.
  Requests and update notices are enabled in the seed by default.
* The proposer is instructed to integrate new slash commands into pi's native
  ``/`` autocomplete dropdown alongside built-in commands, with descriptions,
  using prompt templates or extension command registration. The review checks
  that integration and the path from invocation to a visible result, including
  state and an off command for modes. Headless trials cannot verify the dropdown;
  the agent records any unverified interactive checks in its design.
* ``evolution.review_kinds: [code_extension]`` holds code changes pending
  human promotion. Client requirements must pass setup before installation.
* ``evolution.selection: floor`` is the default: the evaluation runs the candidate
  alone and publishes it when every task scores at least
  ``evolution.floor_score`` (``1.0``). The current release is not run, and an
  episode that could not run misses the floor.
* What only you can provide (a phone number, a credential, a permission, an
  account) is a ``requires`` item, ``{name, kind, check?, prompt?}``, whose
  ``prompt`` is one sentence of at most 200 characters that setup shows when
  it asks for the item; the Setup table of the step's page has a prompt
  column. On pi an ``env`` item's value is read at run time from
  ``process.env.NAME``: the proposer is told that an extension never asks
  you for it in the session, never stores it in a file of its own and never
  hardcodes it, and its review lists a value the extension asks for or
  stores itself as uncovered. On another adapter the value reaches the
  harness's environment at run time, and the same holds for its entries.

Adapters other than pi
----------------------

``evolution.adapter`` runs the profile on any bundled adapter. The update
notice is a pi extension, so on another adapter the profile leaves it out
and says so in the log; ``reef-<adapter> update`` installs a new release.
The ``/reefine`` command is one command file there (the reserved entry
``reef-requests``): the session's model files the request with
``reef-<adapter> evolve``, gives you the request's page link, waits for the
step with ``reef-<adapter> wait`` in pieces its shell tool allows, tells you
the result and, on your yes, runs ``reef-<adapter> update``. Start the new
version by starting ``reef-<adapter>`` again.

``terminus`` has no session to type in and no install: a request comes
through ``POST /reef/train``, and ``GET /reef/harness`` serves a published
tree. The agent proposer runs on pi
alone, so another adapter builds no agent and needs no proposer sandbox; on another adapter the served model answers a request with rules,
skills and commands, and with a config entry where the harness's config
enforces a behavior (an opencode agent with a permission map, Claude Code
permissions that pre-approve only ``WebSearch`` and ``WebFetch``, Codex's
``web_search``). It writes no ``code_extension``,
since it knows pi's extension API and no other. The prompt tells it that
harness's own facts from its adapter's ``harness_facts.yaml``: how you
type a command there, which file holds the rules, which tools the harness
has (web search among them, with what it needs: ``DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`` on
dsh) and how the harness offers a mode. The review judges new commands by
the same facts. Its design says when the request needs behavior these
kinds cannot give. On ``claude``, ``codex``, ``hermes`` and ``dsh`` a
command cannot take a tool away, so a mode there is guidance the model
follows while every tool stays offered: the design and the command's reply
say so, the mode's state lives in the conversation (the command's reply and
the header on each reply) and never in a file a tool writes or reads, the
model declines a skill the person's message loads while the mode is on and
names the mode's off command rather than a way around it (Claude Code's
``!`` line, say), and the review lists a request for a hard restriction
under limits. On
``opencode`` an agent with a permission map is the mode, and the model gets
only the tools it allows: an answer whose agent has no permission map is
written again, since that agent is offered every tool. A command's
``agent:`` runs only that command's turn, so the person enters the mode with
``/agents`` (or with its command as a new session's first message) and
leaves it with ``/agents``, choosing build, together with a leave command
whose text says every tool is back: opencode tells the model nothing when
the agent changes. The permission map limits the model's own tool calls
only; a skill the person types, a file attached with ``@`` and a ``!``
command still run, and the review lists them under limits. On ``codex`` a
``web_search`` config entry turns the hosted search on in every session of
the release, which How to use says. A ``terminus`` run has no reply a
person reads, so its design names the files the task leaves, the
verifier's reward and the trajectory as the visible result, and its pages
name no wrapper command: ``GET /reef/harness`` serves the published tree,
and what the release requires must hold in the Harbor task a run uses.

An answer whose form slipped is written again while attempts remain: JSON
that does not parse (a list or an object that decodes inside a broken outer
array is a fragment of it, not the answer), entries every one of which was
dropped, or entries the harness's own admission refuses (the admission the
step meets next runs on each answer). When admission refused the entries,
the retry shows that answer's design and entries, so what it got right
stays. Each dropped answer's reason is recorded
(``proposal_notes.dropped_attempts``), shows in the request page's Activity
while the step runs, and shows under Review on the request and step pages.
A review reply whose JSON a stray quote broke is asked once more. The review
reads the whole design; the step records it cut to 4000 characters with its
last paragraph, the How to use, kept whole.

Off pi, a design that says no entry this harness takes can deliver the
request is an answer, not a failure: the review runs on it, the step
records it under ``proposal_notes.declined`` with the design and what is
out of reach, and the pages and the result line say it was answered with
no change. When that review finds a point an entry could still deliver,
the request is written again. On pi such a reply stays a proposal with
nothing to apply, its reason under ``failure``.

The result line after a published step carries the release's own How to
use (``how to use: ...``, its first paragraph), and ``reef-<adapter>
update`` prints it after the install, so the session tells the person the
form the release takes (``$chat`` on codex) rather than one taken from the
request. What the harness puts out of reach prints one point per line.

The agent proposer
------------------

The text proposer writes an extension it never runs, so a model name it
guessed or a parameter a provider refuses only shows once you use the
change. The agent proposer runs the served model as a pi coding agent
instead. Its working directory holds the tree as one file per entry
(``harness/skills``, ``rules``, ``commands`` and ``extensions``, plus
``requires.json`` and ``design.md``), with Reef's own entries, the
extension API reference among them, read-only beside it. The agent starts
with this deployment's corrected reference, even when the base release
contains an older copy; the release itself stays unchanged. When the
reference omits an interface or leaves behavior unclear,
the agent may read the installed pi package's documentation, type definitions
and relevant source files. It checks the installed version first; if source
is missing locally, it may consult that exact upstream version. The package
is read-only, and delivered entries must use supported public interfaces.
A behavior that requires changes to pi itself is recorded as a limitation
in the design. The agent may also read provider documentation on the network
and has three tools of its own:

* ``harness_check`` runs the working directory through Reef's admission, as
  the step will.
* ``harness_trial`` runs the changed harness for real, online, on a task the
  agent writes, and returns the session's final text, the tools it called,
  every image, speech, embedding or decision call it made with the
  provider's error when one failed, and the end of its stderr.
  Alternatively, its ``script`` input runs literal prompts and slash commands
  in one pi SDK session, using a fixed local OpenAI-compatible model. Steps
  can start a fresh session, force a tool attempt, and assert the actual
  outgoing tool set, system prompt, messages, and recorded fixture tool
  execution. A missing model request cannot satisfy an assertion about its
  payload. Fixture tools cannot replace built-in or candidate tools.
  Scripted trials check session behavior; an online task trial is still
  needed for behavior specific to the configured provider or model, and
  neither mode verifies an interactive dropdown.
* ``harness_progress`` saves short working notes in ``progress.md``: confirmed
  API behavior and source locations, implementation status, and unresolved
  checks. Before each model call, Reef restores these notes, the latest
  check/trial observations and the remaining execution time into context.

While it runs, the request page's Activity lists each tool the agent calls,
each check and trial with its result, and each image or speech call with the
provider's status, so a long run shows what it is doing; opening the
``/reefine`` spinner in pi lists the latest few.

When the agent stops, its files are read back into the step's mutations,
``requires`` items and design, and the review runs as for the text
proposer. The agent's session log lands in the step record as
``agent-session.jsonl``.
Check and trial observations also land in ``agent-checks.jsonl``, identified
by the candidate's SHA-256 checksum. Candidate files, design and progress
notes are retained in ``agent-workspace/`` after checks and at exit, including
timeouts. These are diagnostic files, not published changes or an automatic
resume mechanism. They follow the deployment's step-record retention.

The agent holds no credential. It and its trials reach models through a
loopback gateway whose address carries a random token: the served model
with the served key (always the served model, whatever a request names),
and ``/v1/images``, ``/v1/embeddings``, ``/v1/audio/speech`` and
``/v1/decisions`` on the recipe's multimodal gateway (``evolution.multimodal``,
see below), and the provider's
model list (``GET /models?modality=``, fetched with its key), so the agent picks
a model that exists without holding a key. Every call spends from
``evolution.max_model_calls_per_step`` and is recorded in the step's
``proposer.json``. Nothing else is reachable through it, Reef's own routes
included.

Isolation (``evolution.proposer_agent.sandbox``, or ``REEF_PROPOSER_SANDBOX``):

* ``bwrap`` (the default where the host can): the agent and its trials run in
  a bubblewrap jail with an empty environment, a read-only system and only
  the working directory writable, in a network namespace pasta connects to
  the internet with no host address reachable but the gateway's port. It
  needs ``bwrap`` and ``pasta`` (the ``passt`` package) and a service that
  runs as a non-root user with user namespaces allowed.
* ``e2b``: the agent and its trials run in an `E2B <https://e2b.dev>`__
  cloud sandbox, a microVM with the internet and no route to the Reef host.
  The gateway's port answers at the same loopback address inside it through
  a tunnel Reef opens from its side (a relay in the sandbox that Reef polls
  over the sandbox's public address, with a per-run secret), so it works
  from a laptop as from a server, and no other host port is reachable. The
  agent's files are copied in, refreshed for each check and trial, and copied
  back when it stops. It needs ``pip install 'reef-infra[e2b]'`` and an E2B
  key (``e2b_api_key``, else ``E2B_API_KEY``); ``e2b_template`` names the
  sandbox image, else Reef builds ``reef-pi-<version>`` (the pinned pi on
  Node 22) on first use, in about a minute. The sandbox's own user can reach
  root in it; nothing there holds a key.

  If the command connection drops, Reef attempts to reconnect to the same
  process twice within the original time limit; it does not rerun the command.
  The tunnel retries interrupted response transfers without duplicating chunks.
  A response that cannot be completed remains a failed stream. Failed proposal
  steps appear as ``Failed`` on the request and release pages, with the recorded
  error, and publish no release. After resolving the error, submit the request again.

  .. code:: bash

     E2B_API_KEY=e2b_... reef serve --recipe reefine \
       --inference.upstream-url https://openrouter.ai/api \
       --inference.upstream-model z-ai/glm-5.3 \
       --recipe.config.evolution.proposer_agent.sandbox e2b

* ``none``: no isolation. The agent runs with the service's user and full
  network access, fed your clients' text. Choose it only where you trust
  every client, such as your own machine.
* Left unset on a host that cannot isolate, the agent is off and the text
  proposer answers; the service logs why.

``timeout_s`` (1800) bounds the whole agent run and ``trial_timeout_s`` (300)
each trial. Trials also respect the remaining run budget, reserving the
last 10 percent (at most 60 seconds) for saving files and finishing. The
agent receives a reminder to finish during this interval; it is still
subject to the outer hard timeout. A run past its limit hands back no change.
Set
``evolution.max_model_calls_per_step`` to bound what one request may spend:
an agent run makes a model call per turn and may probe several provider
models before it settles on one.

Images, speech, embeddings and decisions
----------------------------------------

``evolution.multimodal`` names one gateway that serves these modalities behind
a single key. Reef relays a scenario's ``/v1/images``, ``/v1/embeddings``,
``/v1/audio/speech`` and ``/v1/decisions`` to it with the key, the way the
upstream serves chat: an extension calls them at ``REEF_SERVICE_URL`` with the
scenario and token headers, in the provider's own format, and holds no provider
key. Nothing is recorded, so these calls are not learning signal. The agent
proposer's trials reach the same gateway, so an extension it proves in a trial
calls what the harness will call.

.. code:: yaml

   evolution:
     multimodal:
       preset: openrouter          # or openai-compatible (OrcaRouter, LiteLLM, ...)
       url: https://openrouter.ai/api   # the preset's address unless set; required for openai-compatible
       api_key: ${REEF_MULTIMODAL_API_KEY}   # or api_key_env: NAME

``api_key`` takes the key the way ``inference.upstream_api_key`` takes the chat
key; the profile sets it to ``${REEF_MULTIMODAL_API_KEY}``, and
``--recipe.config.evolution.multimodal.api_key`` sets it on the command line.
Empty, the upstream key serves when the upstream is the same address, so a
deployment that chats through OpenRouter needs nothing more. Without a key,
or for a route the preset does not serve (``openai-compatible`` has no
decisions), those routes answer 501. Recipes other than reefine offer none.

The health floor
----------------

The profile's one evaluation task is a health check:

.. code:: yaml

   tasks:
     - '[health] Run the shell command `echo reef-ok` with your shell tool and reply with its exact output
       as a plain word alone on the last line.'

The bundled evaluator grades the reply's last line, ``reef-ok`` exactly. The
floor answers one question: does the tree still work after the change? The
model binding answers, the shell tool runs, every extension loads. It says
nothing about whether the change does what was asked; the step's design and
review notes and the person judge that. Set both ``evolution.tasks`` and
``evolution.evaluate`` for a workload of your own, and
``evolution.selection: score_comparison`` to require the candidate to beat
the current release on them instead.

What the step records
---------------------

Every step's catalog row carries the request under
``metrics.training_request`` and the proposer's notes under
``metrics.proposal_notes``; the step page
(``GET /reef/harness/releases/<step>/page``, ``reef-pi page <version>``) renders
them:

* ``design``: the proposer's plan for the request, a few sentences, as the
  page's Design section.
* ``review``: the second call's result, ``complete`` or ``partial``, with
  the points of the request the entries cover and the ones they leave
  uncovered, and the ``limits`` the harness puts out of reach, as the
  Review section; the result line in the session and from ``--wait`` names
  the uncovered points and the limits. Absent when the review call
  failed, which never blocks the step.
* ``refused_requires``: the ``requires`` items the proposer wrote that could
  not be honored, each with the reason, under "refused by the step" in the
  Setup section. An ``env`` item whose check is a shell test is brought to
  the one variable it names first, so ``test -n "$TOKEN"`` becomes the
  variable ``TOKEN`` rather than a refusal.
* ``undeclared_env``: the variables a written extension reads through
  ``process.env`` that no ``requires`` item names. Nothing adds them; the
  page shows them so you can set them or ask for the item.
* ``failure``: why a request step produced no change: the model call
  failed (how long it took, the reply budget and the endpoint's error; a
  reply without text adds that a thinking model may have spent the budget
  on its reasoning and names ``REEF_PROPOSER_MAX_TOKENS``) or the reply
  held no usable entry. The result line in the session and from ``--wait``
  quotes it, and the page shows it as ``proposer failure`` in the Result
  section.

All ``CordisRecipe`` evolution settings remain available, including custom
proposers, seeds, execution settings, and publication policies.

``REEF_PROPOSER_TIMEOUT_S`` and ``REEF_PROPOSER_MAX_TOKENS`` override the model
call budgets. Defaults are 600 seconds and 65536 reply tokens for the call that
answers an instruction (a thinking model reasons for tens of thousands of tokens
before it writes an extension), 60 seconds and 4096 tokens for the short plan
call before it, 120 seconds and 16384 tokens for the review after it, and 60
seconds and 8192 tokens for failure-driven proposals; the reply budgets are
sized for a thinking model, which spends part of the budget on its reasoning
before the JSON (a review budget of 8192 came back empty on one). The
tutorial's ``run.sh`` sets 900 seconds and 16384 tokens for its local model.

Migration
---------

The former ``tutorials/harness-requests/`` directory is now
``tutorials/reefine/``. Existing runs can retain their state by moving their
``work/`` directory and keeping the old scenario name in the driver. The
``evolve-your-harness`` tutorial's proposer and evaluator entrypoints delegate
to Reefine, so its existing configurations continue to work.
