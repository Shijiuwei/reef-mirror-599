"""Single-Rollout Asynchronous Optimization (arXiv:2607.07508): one method, one package.

- ``recipe`` — the SAO recipe class and its ``WeightTrainingSpec``.
- ``processor`` — one scored rollout, one batch unit.
- ``objective`` — the backend-agnostic training objective.
- ``slime`` — the Slime loss family (DIS ratio, actor/critic cadence) and
  its torch objective. Imported by the training driver and workers only;
  this package's public surface never loads it.
