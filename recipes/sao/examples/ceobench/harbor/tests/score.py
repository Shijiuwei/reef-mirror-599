"""Score one CEO-Bench run from its ``world.nmdb``.

Usage: ``score.py <runs-dir> <verifier-dir>``. Finds the run directory the
harness left under ``<runs-dir>``, decrypts its ``world.nmdb`` with the
benchmark's own reader, and writes ``<verifier-dir>/reward.json``:

    reward         final cash over the starting balance (1.0 = break-even)
    final_cash     the benchmark's primary metric, in dollars
    survival_days  the last simulated day the run reached
    bankrupt       1 if the run ended below zero cash

The harness-level ``world.nmdb`` is the copy the runner makes at every
checkpoint; when a run was cut off before its first checkpoint, the live
session database is scored instead. Nothing here trusts the agent's own
accounting (config.json only supplies the starting balance).
