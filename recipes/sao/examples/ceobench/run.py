"""One CEO-Bench episode, trained while it is played.

    solve  — reef-eval runs the harbor/ task under our agent; the benchmark's
             bash agent plays the configured number of days with every model
             call served by Reef
    learn  — when a week ends, the agent reports that week's turns with the
             week's change in company value (cash plus the subscription
             run-rate over the weeks left); Reef's SAO recipe trains on the
             accepted turns while the agent is already playing the next
             week, and the engine serves the updated adapter
    verify — Harbor's verifier scores the finished run from its world.nmdb

This is test-time training: the policy adapts inside the episode it is
scored on. ``CEOBENCH_SEED`` (default ``42``) and ``CEOBENCH_DAYS`` (default
``500``) pick the episode. Replicates are independent runs from the base
model, one stack each: a Reef process trains one scenario for its lifetime,
so a second seed on the same stack would start from the first seed's adapter.
After the episode the loop waits for the scenario's version chain to stop
growing, so the adapter on disk is the one the episode ended with.
