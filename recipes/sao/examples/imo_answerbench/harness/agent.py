"""Harbor agent that drives several scored rollouts of one IMO problem through Reef.

The problem arrives as the trial's ``instruction``. The agent looks up its gold
answer and runs ``ROLLOUTS`` rollouts through Reef's ``/v1/chat/completions``,
scoring each \\boxed{} answer against the gold with the strict equivalence rule
the Harbor verifier uses and reporting the binary reward (1.0 correct, 0.0 wrong)
against that rollout's receipt — one candidate training step per rollout. The last
completion is written to ``/workspace/answer.txt`` for the Harbor verifier, and a
watcher thread posts the verifier's own reward to Reef once Harbor ends the trial.
