"""What one SPADE generation records: each proposal's fate, each task's measure, and the experience the next prompt carries.

The Designer is asked for one environment at the edge of what the agent can do today (SPADE Sec. 4.1);
the request carries what the agent did on the last generation's environments, sorted by the hint based
regret of Sec. 4.2 into the frontier (the hint turns losses into wins), the mastered (won without it) and
the out of reach (lost even with it), so the next environment lands where the agent fails without a hint
and passes with one. ``experience_text`` is that section of the prompt; the generic task designer in
``reef.record2dataset`` carries it as data. The rest of this module is the bookkeeping of one generation,
which ``SpadeProcessor`` writes under its state directory and reads back after a restart.
