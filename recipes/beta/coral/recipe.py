"""The CORAL weight-training recipe: what a deployment names in ``serve.yaml``.

Binds :class:`~recipes.beta.coral.processor.CoralProcessor` to the grouped
relative-reward training machinery. CORAL sibling groups have the same shape
as TTT-Discover steps — comparison sets of scored rollouts from one shared
starting point — so the recipe reuses the ``tttd`` training objective (grouped
adaptive-entropic leave-one-out advantages) and the ``tttd`` Slime loss
family rather than duplicating either. The recipe's own configuration is the
group barrier.

Deployment reference: ``recipes.beta.coral.recipe:CoralRecipe``. Run from
the repository checkout, which also provides the ``tttd`` registrations this
recipe reuses; ``reef serve`` finds it beside the example config.
