"""The whole loop, in the open.

One episode:

    solve  — reef-eval runs the harbor/ task under our agent; the agent asks
             Reef for the answer (Reef records the exchange, returns a
             receipt)
    verify — Harbor's isolated verifier scores the attempt
    learn  — the agent reports the verifier score against the receipt;
             Reef trains on it and serves the next version

``Lab.run`` is reef-eval's one primitive: task in, trusted scored row out.
