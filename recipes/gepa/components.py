"""The GEPA candidate as named texts, and the diff back into mutations.

GEPA optimizes a ``dict[str, str]``: one instruction text per named
component of the program under search, and every reflective mutation
rewrites exactly one entry of that mapping. Reef's evolution backend speaks
a composition tree instead - ``(kind, config)`` pairs in tree order, with
entry ids stripped - so this module is the translation both ways: which
nodes are evolvable text, what GEPA calls each one, and how a rewritten
mapping becomes the ``Mutation`` sequence the backend applies.

A component key doubles as the entry id the mutation addresses, under the
seed id convention ``GEPARecipe`` validates: a ``rules`` node has entry id
``rules``, and a named node's entry id is its ``config.name``. Because
``propose`` never sees entry ids, that convention is the only thing that
lets a proposal point back at the node a text came from.
