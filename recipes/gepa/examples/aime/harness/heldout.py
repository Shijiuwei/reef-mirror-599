"""Per-example checkpoints for the two sealed test passes.

A test pass is 150 Pi episodes against one composition, so it is the part of
a run most likely to be interrupted and the part that must never be paid for
twice. Each example's score lands in its own file keyed by the example and
the composition it was measured on; a resumed pass skips what is finished and
refuses a checkpoint written for a different composition rather than folding
it into the score.
