"""The AIME benchmark as the GEPA method's task side: pins, scorer, feedback.

Everything the method needs to know about AIME lives here, and nothing here
knows about GEPA: ``evaluate`` and ``feedback`` are the two hooks
``gepa.yaml`` names under ``evolution``, and the mechanism calls them with a
task prompt and an episode result. The answer table is keyed by the prompt
text because that is all the mechanism carries - ``evolution.tasks`` is a
list of strings - so the splits are loaded once and indexed by problem
statement.

The upstream quickstart's scoring rule and its feedback wording are
reproduced here rather than imported: this example exists to show the Reef
method matching GEPA's published numbers, so a runtime dependency on the
package under comparison would defeat it. The original is
``gepa.adapters.default_adapter.ContainsAnswerEvaluator`` at the v0.1.2 tag
(commit 92dadfff), MIT licensed, copyright Lakshya A Agrawal and the GEPA
contributors. The minibatch order is the method's (``recipes/gepa/archive.py``),
drawn from the same generator as its parent choice, as upstream draws it.
