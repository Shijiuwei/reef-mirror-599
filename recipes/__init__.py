"""Cookbook methods, one package each.

``recipes/<method>/`` holds a method's recipe, processor, objective and (for
weight methods) its ``slime/`` backend half, plus ``examples/`` — the
runnable Harbor task + harness stacks that drive it. ``recipes/basic`` is the
example for the core record-only ``recipe``, which has no method package.
Beta methods live under ``recipes/beta/<method>/`` with the same layout.
Reef does not import this tree, and none of it ships in the wheel. Example
deployments select recipe and loss classes through explicit dotted references.
