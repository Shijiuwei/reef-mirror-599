"""OpenClaw-RL (arXiv:2603.10165): one method, one package.

- ``recipe`` — the OpenClaw-RL recipe class and its ``WeightTrainingSpec``.
- ``processor`` — the computed-feedback processor: sessions correlated from
  record tags or, as a fallback, matching traces; turns judged on a
  processor-private PRM worker.
- ``sessions`` / ``turns`` / ``prm`` — the derivation machinery the
  processor calls: how a session is recognized, what one turn's judgment
  gets and answers, what one PRM call does.
- ``objective`` — the backend-agnostic training objective.
- ``slime`` — the Slime loss family, its torch objective, and the frozen
  Megatron teacher. Imported by the training driver and workers only; this
  package's public surface never loads it.
