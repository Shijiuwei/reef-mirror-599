"""The OpenClaw-RL processor: judge every main turn by its next state.

A computed-feedback recipe on the shared engine
(:class:`~reef.train.processors.computed.ComputedFeedbackProcessor` owns the record
lifecycle, the judging worker, and the batch cycle). This file is the
method: ``ingest`` correlates main turns into sessions and hands each
completed turn over for judgment, ``judge`` is upstream's combine
dispatch, ``make_sample`` validates the tensors, ``make_batch`` shapes
the batch. One turn, one judgment, one sample — rewards pass through raw
(upstream ``--n-samples-per-prompt 1``; no grouping, no normalization).

No proxy and no judgment on the wire: the method derives every verdict
from the traffic the agent already produces. Correlation prefers a
harness-stamped ``x-reef-tag-session`` and falls back to trace matching,
which holds only for agents that resend their transcript each turn. The
machinery — session matching, the PRM clients — lives in
:mod:`recipes.openclawrl`.
